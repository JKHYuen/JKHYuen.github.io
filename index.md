I have been designing and programming games since 2013. **With two fully featured product <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Ka%20Hin%20Yuen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releases on Steam</a>** as a solo indie developer, I have an intimate understanding of the skills required to create a video game from start to finish. I am primarily a programmer, however, I have always been determined to learn whatever it takes to transform game ideas into interactive experiences. I take pride in learning everything thoroughly and properly, starting at low-level concepts to build arbitrary complex systems. This process has allowed me to be independent and autodidactic when creating and experimenting with new ideas.

**I specialize in gameplay systems design/programming and technical art (shader development).** Although my 10+ years of game development and programming experience is primarily in solo projects, I am very excited to join the professional industry to learn from experts in the field and contribute with my set of skills. I have a keen interest in RPGs, both as a player and a developer (some favorites: *TES4: Oblivion*, *Path of Exile*, *Dragon Age: Origins*). However, I always strive to keep an open mind to experience as many games as possible; to discover new and creative ideas for enjoyment and knowledge to improve on my own game designs. When I'm not making games, you will probably find me playing them.
