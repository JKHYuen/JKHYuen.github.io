I have been designing and programming games since 2013. As a solo indie developer, I have extensive experience creating video games from start to finish. **With two fully featured product releases on Steam**, I have an intimate understanding of the skills required to create a video game. I am primarily a programmer, however, I have always been determined to learn whatever it takes to transform game ideas into interactive experiences. I take pride in learning everything thoroughly and properly, starting at low-level concepts to build arbitrary complex systems. This process has allowed me to be independent and autodidactic when creating and experimenting with new ideas.

**I specialize in gameplay systems design/programming and technical art.** Although my 10+ years of game development experience is primarily solo, I am very excited to join the professional industry to learn from experts in the field and contribute with my set of skills. I have a keen interest in RPGs, both as a player and a developer (some favorites: TES4: Oblivion, Path of Exile, Dragon Age: Origins). However, I always strive to keep an open mind and explore whatever is available; to experience new and creative games for enjoyment and knowledge to improve on my own game designs. When I'm not making games, you will probably find me playing them.
